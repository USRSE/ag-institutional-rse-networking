# Welcome

The Institutional RSE Networking Affinity Group connects Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who support or aspire to develop RSE communities within their organizations. Whether your institution has an established RSE program or is just beginning to recognize RSE work, this group provides a collaborative space to share strategies and experiences. Our members focus on:

Identifying and connecting with RSEs across institutional departments
Building sustainable local RSE communities
Developing effective networking and engagement strategies
Sharing best practices for community leadership
We welcome participants at any stage of their RSE community-building journey, from those exploring initial steps to those leading established groups. Through regular meetings, members exchange practical insights on community outreach, event planning, and maintaining active engagement while addressing the unique organizational contexts and challenges each institution faces.
