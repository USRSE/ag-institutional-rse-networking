This community would not only foster professional growth but also provide a supportive environment for all involved.</p><p>However, we also acknowledged the challenges that lay ahead. Time constraints, introvert tendencies, and the ongoing debate between virtual and in-person connections were just a few of the hurdles we anticipated. Additionally, understanding and aligning with others’ motivations would be crucial for the community’s success.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we decided to start small. Our first step was to create a spreadsheet of potential contacts who might be interested in joining our community. We affectionately refer to these individuals as Northwestern University Research Software Engineers, or NURSEs. Once we have compiled a sufficient list of emails, we plan to reach out to them and invite them to be part of this exciting initiative.</p><p>While we haven’t reached that stage yet, we believe that taking small, deliberate steps, even under constraints, is more productive than doing nothing. Our journey is just beginning, and we are eager to see how our community will grow and evolve. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build a strong network of research software engineers at Northwestern University.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
