&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of research software engineering (RSE), collaboration and community are key to success. Recently, I had the opportunity to connect with my colleague, Luke Rasmussen, through USRSE’s Slack group. Both of us, working remotely, decided to meet via Zoom to discuss our shared vision for creating a vibrant RSE community at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation was fueled by a common desire to empower and motivate each other as software engineers. We envisioned a space where siloed developers could connect, share ideas, and contribute to individual grants. This community would not only foster professional growth but also provide a supportive environment for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Let's Get Them in a Room!</title><link>https://usrse.github.io/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-04_jd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:38:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://usrse.github.io/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-04_jd/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By Julia Damerow, Arizona State University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work remotely for Arizona State University (ASU), but from time to time I get to go back to Arizona and meet people in person. When I went back in April of this year, my colleague Susan Massey and I planned an in-person meeting of RSEs that work across ASU. For context, at this point we have an informal group of people doing RSE work at ASU. We meet monthly and each meeting is usually attended by somewhere between 4 and 7 people. Our network is a little bit bigger than the people who usually show up for our meetings, but it’s still tiny compared to how many RSEs there must be at ASU (which has over 18,000 employees and over 5,000 faculty). Susan and I set out with the goal to make this the biggest RSE meeting at ASU so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>QR Redirect</title><link>https://usrse.github.io/ag-institutional-rse-networking/qr/usrse25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://usrse.github.io/ag-institutional-rse-networking/qr/usrse25/</guid><description>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://usrse.github.io/ag-institutional-rse-networking/"&gt;
