[{"id":0,"href":"/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-12-meeting-recap/","title":"December Meetup Summary—Communities and People!","section":"Posts","content":" Communities Are Made up of People # For our December meetup, we had chosen two podcast episodes for discussion. Both episodes were from the Open Source Stories podcast.\nChanging communities have changing needs with Andy Piper Community health and belonging with Anita Ihuman While focusing on open source communities and not on building local communities around a career choice, both episodes were very insightful and applicable to our problem at hand: how can we build and sustain a local RSE community at our institutions.\nOur discussion went something like this:\n“Anita said this and that, which made me think this.”\n“Yes, and she also said this. But I think Andy talked about this over here, which somewhat relates.”\n“Yes! And that reminds me of this over there.”\n…\nSuffice to say, it would be useless to try and give you a recount of this. Instead here are a few of our main takeaways.\nOne of the statements that stuck out to us, was one made by Andy Piper:\nA lot of developers, in my experience, just want to write something cool and do something fun, and, “Works on my machine, ship it.” Again, I’m not treating all developers like that, but it is a sense of excitement that you have when you build something new.\nWe both could very much relate to this statement! Likely, almost every developer feels this to some extent. We get excited about building something new, being creative, architecting something that hasn’t been there before, but this excitement decreases once it basically works, and now we have to polish it and fix the bugs. Building a community is a little bit like this. In the beginning, you might get some people excited when you share your ideas and visions with them, but after the first few meetings, when things slow down and you need to put some structure and processes in place, then it’s harder to get motivated and push forward. Especially when building a community, you often only see what you have accomplished when looking back. Relating this back to our last blog post about the types of people you need to build a community, you first need to find the passionate ones, the ones that will keep pushing even when the excitement ebbs away. Once you have those, you can shift focus to draw others in.\nKeeping the members of a community excited is also closely tied to the feeling of belonging, that Anita Ihuman discusses. Which raised the question for us, who do we want to belong to our local RSE communities? There are arguments to be made for both, a very broad community that aims to include anyone just slightly related to RSE work, but also for a more narrowly focused community that concentrates on the needs of RSEs at the institution. This is not necessarily a question that first comes to mind when just trying to find some like-minded people, and it might not be necessary to define this upfront. But as the community grows and develops goals, this is definitely worth thinking about.\nThis discussion will also help with setting expectations, which is another point we discussed quite a bit. What do we expect from the members in our community? And what do we expect from the different types of members (the passionate ones, the engaged ones, and the lurkers)? How can we encourage our members to contribute according to our expectations? How can we make clear to new (and existing) members what those expectations are? These questions are especially important when considering a point Anita made: that a bad first experience can make someone silently turn away on the spot, and you wouldn’t get the opportunity to ask them why.\nGood first (and continuous) experiences, however, require a welcoming community in which people feel seen and comfortable communicating with others. We discussed for a while, how this is a lot harder when you build a virtual community vs. building an in-person one. In a community, in which members are physically located near to each other, you can make a point of stopping by others, have the water-cooler chat, get to know each other and learn about what drives and challenges the other person. You can even go so far as picking someone up to ensure they’ll join a meetup or other event and make them feel welcomed. In a virtual community, many of these strategies fail. It’s easy to drop in and out of meetings, hiding behind turned off cameras and microphones. You can’t just turn to your left and get to know the person next to you unless this is explicitly organized by the meeting moderator. There are approaches to encourage interactions between participants, the easiest being a round of introductions whenever someone new joins (in virtual meetings), or prompt responses and welcome messages on asynchronous communication tools. This also requires that the leaders of a community recognize that these strategies are important for community health. Another point, Anita touches on: “You can only figure out the need to find a solution when you’ve actually seen that that is a problem.”\nThe two podcast episodes had many other great points and thought-provoking statements. We encourage you to read them and share your thoughts with us on Slack or our next meetup. They definitely gave us some new ideas about how to go about creating a local RSE community, which strategies might help us, and what things we might not have considered yet could be important. So all in all, another very worthwhile hour spent!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-11-meeting-recap/","title":"November Meetup Summary—Totally Worth Reading!","section":"Posts","content":" Building a Community\u0026mdash;It\u0026rsquo;s the economy vision, stupid! # On November 18, 2025, the institutional networking affinity group got together to discuss “10 recommended practices for creating a robust community of remote developers”. Ok, we’ll be honest, it was just J.C. and Julia, but it was a very productive discussion. In this blog post, we’ll summarize the discussion highlights for everyone who could not be at the meeting or for whomever stumbles across this post in the future.\nA good chunk of the meeting was spent discussing the first point in the reading—“Cultivate a Shared Vision and Purpose.” We agreed that this was potentially the most important point of all. If you don’t have a vision for the community you are trying to build, then people do not have an incentive to join the community and engage with it. Creating a vision for a local RSE community can be challenging, however, as many of us want to achieve so many different things such as enabling RSEs to connect and learn from each other, advocating for the RSEs at their institution to increase recognition of their work, and creating a career path for RSEs. This wide range of goals can muddy the waters to an extent that it becomes hard to decide where to start and what step to take first.\nWhile talking about visions and community goals, the following thought came up (which is likely better discussed somewhere else, feel free to let us know any good readings about this!). For our purposes, we identified three different types of community members:\nThe passionate, core members that drive the community forward. The engaged members that show up to meetings and contribute to an extent. The “listening in” members that are part of a Slack channel or mailing list, but are not engaging for the most part. When trying to create a local RSE community, we came to the conclusion that first you need to find one or two other people who share your passion and become core members. You need this support for your community building efforts as this is something you cannot do all by yourself. Once you have your core group of members, you want to grow the other two layers of your community. You need people who show up to events you organize and maybe contribute to the organization of those events or are willing to present at them. And last but not least, you’ll need the “listening in” members that are aware of your efforts, show up to events from time to time, and most importantly can spread the word. While it can be frustrating at times like shouting into void and hearing nothing back, it is important to remember that even if no one responds, it doesn’t mean that no one heard your message.\nIt is also important to be aware of these different types of community members when planning events and activities. While any activity should be in support of your overall vision, different activities speak to different types of community members. Not all kinds of events will be met with the same enthusiasm by all members. For instance, a meetup to discuss a specific technology will likely have fewer attendees than a talk on a specific project or topic as a “listening in” member is more likely to attend a talk where they can hang back and not engage than a meetup that comes with the expectation for attendees to contribute.\nTurning back to the reading, we agreed that many of the points were geared towards bigger communities that have the capacity to organize more structured programs. However, we did discuss the idea of mentorship for a little while. We came to the conclusion that this is something that would be an argument for institutions to support any local community building efforts. Many RSEs are fairly isolated in their groups being the only RSE on a team, which can mean a lack of technical but also career mentorship. This can lead to frustrations and dissatisfaction with the position, which in turn may result in RSEs leaving the organization. A local RSE community can foster connections between RSEs from different groups and departments that might lead to mentorship relationships and higher job satisfaction. This can help in retaining talent, which is in the interest of the overall organization.\nWe also discussed various other topics as they came up during our meeting. However, some of those were just mentioned as a side note while others deserve their own blog posts. We might expand on some of them in future meetings. A first one that comes to mind is the development of a list of arguments about why supporting local RSE communities is in their interest. So stay tuned!\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-05_js/","title":"NURSEs.xlsx","section":"Posts","content":"In the ever-evolving world of research software engineering (RSE), collaboration and community are key to success. Recently, I had the opportunity to connect with my colleague, Luke Rasmussen, through USRSE’s Slack group. Both of us, working remotely, decided to meet via Zoom to discuss our shared vision for creating a vibrant RSE community at Northwestern University.\nOur conversation was fueled by a common desire to empower and motivate each other as software engineers. We envisioned a space where siloed developers could connect, share ideas, and contribute to individual grants. This community would not only foster professional growth but also provide a supportive environment for all involved.\nHowever, we also acknowledged the challenges that lay ahead. Time constraints, introvert tendencies, and the ongoing debate between virtual and in-person connections were just a few of the hurdles we anticipated. Additionally, understanding and aligning with others’ motivations would be crucial for the community’s success.\nDespite these challenges, we decided to start small. Our first step was to create a spreadsheet of potential contacts who might be interested in joining our community. We affectionately refer to these individuals as Northwestern University Research Software Engineers, or NURSEs. Once we have compiled a sufficient list of emails, we plan to reach out to them and invite them to be part of this exciting initiative.\nWhile we haven’t reached that stage yet, we believe that taking small, deliberate steps, even under constraints, is more productive than doing nothing. Our journey is just beginning, and we are eager to see how our community will grow and evolve. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build a strong network of research software engineers at Northwestern University.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/ag-institutional-rse-networking/posts/2025-04_jd/","title":"Let's Get Them in a Room!","section":"Posts","content":"I work remotely for Arizona State University (ASU), but from time to time I get to go back to Arizona and meet people in person. When I went back in April of this year, my colleague Susan Massey and I planned an in-person meeting of RSEs that work across ASU. For context, at this point we have an informal group of people doing RSE work at ASU. We meet monthly and each meeting is usually attended by somewhere between 4 and 7 people. Our network is a little bit bigger than the people who usually show up for our meetings, but it’s still tiny compared to how many RSEs there must be at ASU (which has over 18,000 employees and over 5,000 faculty). Susan and I set out with the goal to make this the biggest RSE meeting at ASU so far.\nFirst, we drafted a description of the meeting and put it on our website (we have an RSE website for ASU at rse.asu.edu!). We asked people to register via a Google form so we would know how many people to expect. We planned to provide some refreshments to entice attendance. We sent the meeting advertisement out to our mailing list of people that have indicated interest in RSE-related events in the past and advertised the event in our ASU-RSE Slack channel. We then drafted personal emails to the RSEs we knew that usually don’t come to our meetings to make sure the event was on their radar. Finally, we employed the brute-force method of searching the ASU directory for “research software engineer” and “scientific software engineer”, which brought up a handful of results each. We emailed all the people with those titles and sent them the meeting invitation (basically saying “Hi, my name is Julia. I am an RSE and I think you are too! You should come to our meeting!”).\nOur efforts were met with success! We had a total of 12 people at our meeting and at least 3 of those were new faces. The amazing thing about this group of people was that the situation was different for almost everyone in the room. Some people were of the type “long wolf RSE” that didn\u0026rsquo;t have any other RSE colleagues, while others worked in teams, big as well as small. Some people developed web applications, some worked with LLMs, and some worked on scientific code and HPC resources. So naturally, the experiences of each person differed greatly.\nTo give the meeting some structure, we created a short agenda to make sure everyone was on the same page. We introduced our efforts up to this point, talked about the RSE movement in general (to make sure everyone knew about US-RSE!), and then went around the room for everyone to introduce themselves and their work. Afterwards, we posed a few questions to get a discussion started. We encouraged everyone to share their career path and thoughts on what ASU could provide to make their work better. It was an engaging and very interesting discussion. We talked about the differences between software engineering and research software engineering, the different projects people worked on, and how RSEs at ASU could support each other and connect.\nIn summary, this in person meeting was a great step forward for the RSE community at ASU. More people now know about our efforts, we have more contacts, and word-of-mouth can spread a little farther than before.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/ag-institutional-rse-networking/qr/usrse25/","title":"QR Redirect","section":"Qrs","content":" If you are not redirected, click here.\n"}]
